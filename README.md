# IE_TestCafe_Cucumber_Demo

Hi Guys, I have never integrated cuucmber with testcafe  so it was a bit time consuming. I know the code can be made more functional, modularized and reusabe but was unable to spend time on the same as had a bit of a time crunch.

I was unable to fgure out how to run to run all the scenarios one after the another, i am guessing I made some mistakes in my hooks file, so currently you have to run one by one by commenting all others and due to hte same reason the first scenario outline will pass but rest will fail as I am closing the testcontroller.
Run npm -install on root to set up
